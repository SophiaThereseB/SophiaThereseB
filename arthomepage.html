	<h2> History of Art </h2>
	<p class="paragraphs2"> Truthfully, no one really knows how, when, or where the first piece of art was kindled. However, somewhere, somehow, it was. As far as we know, it all began with medieval art. Medieval art refers to a period known as the Middle Ages, which spanned from 476 A.D. to the 14th century. Art produced during the Middle Ages was based on the Roman Empire, the early Christian church, and the "barbarian" culture of Northern Europe. The medieval art period sprouted into 13 other art periods including the Renaissance, impressionism, cubism, and <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/contemporary-art/m0h0vk?hl=en"> contemporary art.</a> </p>
