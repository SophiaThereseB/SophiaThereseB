	<h2> Biography </h2>
	<p class="paragraphs1"> Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni was born on March 6, 1475 in Caprese, Italy. He was still a young child when his family moved to Florence, Italy, which is where he grew up. He grew up during the Italian Renaissance and was inspired to paint. At thirteen, he became an apprentice for Domenico Ghirlandaio, a Florentine Renaissance painter. Eventually, he was sent to the Medici family, an Italian commerce and banking family. He continued his training with the sculptor, Bertoldo di Geovanni. At the time, he worked for some of the finest artists. On February 18, 1564, he died in his home, located in Rome, Italy due to an illness. </p>

	<h3> Pieta </h3>
	<p class="paragraphs2"> Michelangelo was a Renaissance artist. The Renaissance was an art period that sparked a revival of interest in the classical fundamentals of ancient Greece and Rome. When Michelangelo moved to Rome, he was commissioned by French Cardinal Jean de Bilh√®res -- a representative of Rome -- to create a sculpture called Pieta. <i> Pieta </i> is currently housed in St. Peter's Basilica, Vatican City. It's one of the many significant pieces of Renaissance art. </p>
	
	<h3> The Attack on Pieta </h3>
	<p class="paragraphs2"> In 1972, a crazy man named Laszlo Toth jumped an altar railing in St. Peter's Basilica and dealt multiple hammer blows to the iconic Renaissance sculpture. Toth broke Mary's nose and left about 100 other fragments laying on the floor. After the whole ordeal, he was locked up in an insane asylum and later released with no press charges. </p>
